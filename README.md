Activity 1 : Hello Streamlit!

ðŸ“Œ I began by setting up Streamlit and laying out the app using simple display functions like `st.title`, `st.header` and `st.write`. After that, I added input fields to collect a userâ€™s name and age, and used that data to instantly show a personalized message, making the app feel responsive and engaging.

Activity 2 : DataFrame Viewer

ðŸ“Œ In this task, I used Streamlit to build an interactive web application and pandas to handle data loading and manipulation. The app allows users to upload a CSV file using `st.file_uploader`, view the data with `st.dataframe`, and toggle raw data display using `st.checkbox`. I also implemented `st.selectbox` to let users filter the DataFrame by selecting a column and a specific value from it.

Activity 3 : Sidebar and Layout

ðŸ“Œ I created a Streamlit app that effectively organizes content on Data Warehousing and Enterprise Data Management. I used `st.sidebar` to add filters and display options, while `st.tabs` and `st.columns` helped structure the information clearly. To make the content more interactive, I included `st.expander` for sections that reveal additional details when needed.

Activity 4 : Fetch and Display API Data

ðŸ“ŒTo solve the problem, I built an interactive COVID-19 statistics dashboard using Streamlit. I fetched live data from an API, allowed users to select countries via the sidebar, and displayed key metrics using various charts like bar, line, pie, area, and geo maps. This setup makes it easy to visualize and compare the COVID-19 situation across different countries in real time.

Activity 5 : Data PipeLine with Database

ðŸ“ŒTo meet the objective of integrating a Streamlit app with a MySQL database, I used SQLAlchemy to establish a connection and executed SQL queries to retrieve and filter employee data. The results were displayed using `st.dataframe`, and new entries were added via a Streamlit form. I also implemented a basic login system to restrict access and ensure only authorized users can interact with the application.

Activity 6 : Real-Time Video Stream with CV

ðŸ“Œ The objectives were achieved by integrating OpenCV with Streamlit to capture real-time webcam video and apply dynamic filters. A sidebar dropdown allowed users to choose between Canny edge detection, face detection using Haar cascades, grayscale, and blur effects, each with adjustable parameters. Snapshot functionality was added to capture and display filtered frames on demand.
