Activity 1 : Hello Streamlit!

ðŸ“Œ I began by setting up Streamlit and laying out the app using simple display functions like `st.title`, `st.header` and `st.write`. After that, I added input fields to collect a userâ€™s name and age, and used that data to instantly show a personalized message, making the app feel responsive and engaging.
